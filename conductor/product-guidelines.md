# Product Guidelines

## User Experience (UX)
- **Tone:** Professional & Efficient. The interface should be clean, minimalist, and optimized for productivity, allowing users to handle data and layouts quickly.
- **Focus:** Maximize data density and minimize friction for core tasks like uploading, processing, and reviewing.

## Design & Visual Identity
- **Flexibility:** While automation is key, the system must support flexible layouts. Generated PSDs should be editable, allowing designers to make necessary manual adjustments and tweaks to the final output.

## Technical Principles
- **Reliability:** Prioritize robust error handling. The system must gracefully handle file I/O issues, Excel parsing errors, and Photoshop automation glitches, ensuring no data is lost and the user is always informed of the state.

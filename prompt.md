I’m building a multi-user Python-based catalog system that integrates data from Excel into Photoshop designs and allows publishing structured outputs. The workflow starts with an Excel sheet containing product and supplier data. I want to 1) read and parse the Excel data, 2) create Photoshop (PSD) layouts from this data dynamically (using layer information), 3) store both the data and references to PSD layers in a custom database, 4) be able to go backward—check a PSD and verify against the original Excel data, 5) allow users to recall visual history and catalog archives via a GUI, 6) handle multiple users performing different tasks (like updating designs, recalling archives, etc.) concurrently, 7) generate structured outputs (like XML) for platforms such as Google Merchant Center, and 8) ensure the database and system are scalable and safe (with backups and access control).

I plan to use Python libraries like pandas/openpyxl for Excel, psd-tools for PSD manipulation, and a web framework like Flask or FastAPI for the GUI and server. I’ll need a relational database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL) for structured data. The system should allow users to trigger tasks (like generating PSDs or querying archives) concurrently, and I’ll need to manage background tasks for heavier operations (like Photoshop automation). Can you help me outline the steps or initial structure for this system?
